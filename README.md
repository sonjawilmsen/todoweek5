This repo consist of a ruby on rails back end with jQuery. Ajax and JSON.I build this during the 5th week of the Codaisseur program. It is turned into an API. In the following repo (https://github.com/sonjawilmsen/todo_react)  you can find the React code that whas used to built the Front end which gets is data from this API.

It gave me a a first look in to how to make a API out of an Ruby back end, and some more experience with JSON. 
The app is a work in progress, for example I will focus on testing with RSpec some more.
