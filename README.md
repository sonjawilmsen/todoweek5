This repo consist of a ruby on rails back end with jQuery. Ajax and JSON. It is turned into an API. In the following repo (https://github.com/sonjawilmsen/todo_react)  you can find the React code that whas used to built the Front end which gets is data from this API.

It gave me a a first look in to how to make a API out of an Ruby back end, and some more experience with JSON.
